# Chada-Clock

1.) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was creating a clock that displayed time in both 12 and 24 hour formats. Chada Tech wanted the user to be able to add time (hour, minute, second) to the clock. 

2.) What did you do particularly well?
I modularized my code correctly and efficiently. Part of the assignment was to ensure our main class had the least amount of code inside. I also thought outside the project guidelines. For example, if you add a minute at 11:59:00 PM. The clock would turn to 12:00:00 AM, instead of going to 11:00:00 PM (This isn't counting seconds, the seconds go up regardless.)

3.) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I am not sure where I could enhance my code. I spent a long time on this project making sure my code was efficient and I didn't have any unneccesary lines. I believe the only thing I could've done better was include more in-line comments.

4.) Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I didn't find too much challenging about this project. The most difficult thing would have to having to find the correct command to bring in system time. That was very difficult to find the correct syntax and have it work in conjuction with my code. Being able to modify system time was the problem. Google is an amazing thing. Stackoverflow is very useful. 

5.) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I believe properly modularizing code will be a transferable skill to other projects. That is one of the most important things in programming. If your code is messy and there are unneccesary lines, it is more likely the code will break.

6.) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I started with one piece at a time. Once I got everything working and the correct output, I then started slimming down my code and optimizing it to the best of my ability.
